Azure Workshop – Designing and Architecting solutions for the Hybrid and private Azure Cloud
13th February 2018
Microsoft Office, Paddington Central, 2 Kingdom Street, Paddington Central, London W2 6PY

 
The move to the cloud has been one of the major recent driving forces for many software companies. Whilst many applications can seamlessly move to the cloud, there are still many scenarios where some form of hybrid solution is needed, whether that is for legal, or policy or commercial reasons.  This technical briefing, aimed at CTOs, software architects or senior system designers, is designed to cover the architectural and technology questions for companies working in highly constrained or regulated industries where security and compliance is paramount and the journey to public cloud is not always straight forward. Join Microsoft & Pulsant as they give you a tour of exactly how to design and build applications that can work in a hybrid scenario, or run in a private data center on Azure Stack.
 
During the workshop we will cover use cases for verticals such as local government, financial services and legal industries and covering scenarios such as;
	· Edge and disconnected solutions where there are latency or connectivity issues or a need for local data processing
	· Cloud applications that meet regulatory or compliance laws for government, industry or geographical regions
	· Modern applications that span cloud and on-premises requirements where there is a need for consistent programming models, skills and processes
 
The emphasis of the seminar is therefore on designing, building and operating applications in hybrid cloud environments utilising Azure and Azure Stack including related technologies, such as, microservices, containerisation and serverless computing. For those new to Azure Stack the session will also discuss the benefits of consistent application development, making Azure services available on premises and how to create an integrated delivery experience for your applications.

This event is targeted at commercial software companies, who build software and IP as their core business, looking to run their applications or solutions on Azure. This event is limited to a maximum of three people per company.
