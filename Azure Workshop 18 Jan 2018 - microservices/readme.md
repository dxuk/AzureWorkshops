slides for Azure Workshop – Serverless, Microservices and Containers 
18th January 2018
Microsoft Office, Paddington Central, 2 Kingdom Street, Paddington Central, London W2 6PY
Microsoft Azure Technical Experts Share Best Practise

Microservices and serverless computing represent the latest evolution of application architectural design, that of breaking down systems into collections of loosely coupled services, to scale better, enjoy lower running costs, be updated and re-deployed in real time. Azure has several native service to help support these model, including Docker containers support. Serverless computing takes elements of these ideas even further, by removing the need to worry about the underlying virtual machines and infrastructure, allowing developers to spend their time building and deploying great apps, rather than managing servers, because the infrastructure is managing it for you. 
 
This workshop will explore microservices, containers and serverless computing and how Microsoft Azure supports these various platforms and programming models
 
	- Azure “Platform as a Service” and messaging capabilities 
	- Azure Container Service (AKS) for Kubernetes
	- Azure Service Fabric
	- Azure Functions
	- Azure Event Grid 
 
So, if are you working with a monolith application architecture and keen to learn how you can decompose it into discreet microservices, or are about to embark on a new project and interested in Microservices and need help to decide on a strategy, then this is the workshop for you.
 
This event is targeted at commercial software companies, who build software and IP as their core business, looking to run their applications or solutions on Azure.
This event is limited to a maximum of three people per company.
