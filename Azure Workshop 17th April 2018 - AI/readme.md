In the new digital revolution, every developer will become an AI developer, every business will create and consume AI services and companies not embracing advanced analytics and modern data technologies will lose their competitive advantage.

As well as being a leading innovator in the AI space, Microsoft has been hard at work building a powerful, trusted platform for developing and delivering AI capabilities. Our goal is to democratize AI, making powerful AI capabilities available for use in any application.

In this workshop we will take a look at the fruits of that hard work. We'll explore the platform components that underpin AI capabilities, the key elements of our AI technology stack as well as how to implement and operationalize so you may add intelligence to your world irrespective of your chosen technology stack.
 
In the workshop we will discuss:
 
	• How to get started with AI
	• Easily integrating AI into your solutions with Cognitive Services
	• Creating, building, training, evaluating and deploying machine learning models
	• Consuming deep neural networks to add intelligence in image, voice and text
	• How Machine learning technologies integrate with familiar technologies such as SQL Server, Visual Studio, Power BI etc
 
We see a tremendous opportunity for AI to amplify human ingenuity, enhancing all our lives with better, smarter ways of doing things.

If you are looking to add intelligence into your world and want to see the key technologies Microsoft has to offer, this is the workshop for you.
