These are the slides for the UK DX workshop 15th Feb 2017 with Data masterclass


This technical briefing, aimed at CTOs, software architects or senior system designers, will explore how you can build robust, scalable and cost effective cloud solutions using Microsoft Azure. These workshops focus on in-depth architectural, technical and design considerations related to Microsoft Azure and are delivered by Microsoft Technical Evangelists. We keep the sessions small and informal to help promote discussion and ensure attendees can highlight area of interest and further investigation. 
 
With increasing demand for Big Data, IoT and Machine Learning workloads, choosing the right data storage options and access strategy is vital when designing highly available, highly scalable and cost effective cloud based systems. This briefing has a specific focus on data and Azure - in the morning we will cover the use of Power BI along with how to ingest data into Azure, using mechanism such as IoT Hub and Stream Analytics, etc.  In the afternoon we will look at a variety of storage options, from Azure's own native storage, through to SQL and NoSQL as a service, data warehouses, and it’s massively scalable Data Lakes, alongside some non-persistent options. This session explores a range of offerings on the Azure platform, along with guidance as how to best match the right store for your workload requirements.
